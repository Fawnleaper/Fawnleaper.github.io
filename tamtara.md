## Void Soulcounter(s)

**Tank:** The Soulcounter will spawn in front of the Cultist Orb when the Priest is defeated. Be ready to grab it before it eats your healer!

## Galvanth The Dominator

Galvanth will summon adds throughout the fight. Some of them will make him invulnerable until they are defeated (as indicated by energy tethers).

**Tank:** Keep an eye out for add spawns. Galvanth also has a PBAoE that will paralyze.

**Healer:** Watch out for aggro when adds spawn. Keep an eye on the Tank and Melee in case they get caught by the Paralyze.

**DPS:** Switch focus to the Imps that provide Galvanth's invulnerable status. Watch your toes when he casts his PBAoE Paralyze.

### *General Dungeon Tips*

This dungeon has a few optional side rooms with treasure chests.

The last barrier is unlocked by running past it and using the interactable in the next room. This room can be a little chaotic for first timers so be careful!
