## Kottos the Gigas

This encounter opens with a gauntlet of adds that can be easily burned down. Eventually Kottos himself will spawn but will go down just as easily.

## Ichorous Ire

The Ichorous Ire is nearly invincible until damaged three times by a Blasting Cap which can be spawned by using the "Improved Blasting Device". 
After the third successful detonation the boss can be quickly defeated.

**Tank:** Keep aggro on Ichorous Ire and all it's blobby parts. 
When the Blasting Cap spawns grab it but don't kill it, keep it close to the boss, and then move out of the way as it's about to explode, keeping the boss within the radius of the bomb.

**Healer:** Watch out for aggro when adds spawn. Try not to get caught in the Blasting Cap's explosion.

**DPS:** Do NOT damage the Blasting Cap add. If it dies prematurely it will NOT explode making the fight go on even longer.
Switch focus to the spriggan that spawns later in the fight. It will try to destroy the Blasting Cap. 
Once the boss has been exploded three times and is in eight pieces AoE like mad until the fight is over.

## Gyges the Great

Gyges will move to break open a wall early in the encounter. Once the wall is broken an add will spawn and run to another wall to do break IT open. If it is not killed before doing so another add will spawn.

**Tank:** Gyges himself does a cleave so make sure to point him away from the party.

**DPS:** Adds attacking the walls will be fixated on attacking said wall so you can DPS without fear of pulling aggro.

### *General Dungeon Tips*

Throughout this dungeon you'll be able to collect pinches of firesand. You'll use these at certain points to blast open barriers and move forward.

Spriggan Copper Carriers are the patrolling variant of the basic Spriggan mobs you'll find here. Keep an eye out for them during your pulls and watch out for their cleave.

A few times during the dungeon big old giants will burst throught the wall like the Kool-Aid Man. Keep cool and handle them like any other mob.
