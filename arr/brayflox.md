## Great Yellow Pelican

**Tank:** 
* Periodic add spawns
* Frontal cone attack

**Healer:** 
* Boss poisons main target

**DPS:** 
* Manage adds when they appear

## Inferno Drake

**Tank:**
* Frontal cleave
* Brayflox will run in periodically and grab enmity. This is unavoidable.
* An add will spawn with Brayflox that can be tanked.

**Healer/DPS:** 
* When Brayflox steals aggro from the boss watch where you're standing and avoid the boss's cleave

## Hellbender

**Tank:** 
* When Hellbender is low on HP a dragon named Aiatar will spawn that must be tanked.

**DPS:**
* Party members will be targeted by and CC'ed in bubbles that can be damaged to free the captured player.
* Switch focus to Aiatar after the tank grabs it.

## Aiatar

Aiatar has two major mechanics. 
* Aiatar has a fast conal breath attack and will also target different players with a poison puddle attack called Toxic Vomit.
* Once Aiatar begins casting Toxic Vomit the targeted player can move before it lands, allowing the party to position the puddles strategically.
* These puddles will persist for a long time and will **heal** Aiatar.

**Tank:**
* If Aiatar is standing in Toxic Vomit pull it to a clear area.

**Healer:**
* Esuna the poison from affected players.

**DPS:**
* Watch out for the Toxic Vomit cast and take care not to drop it on the party or Aiatar.

### *General Dungeon Tips*

* The first checkpoint requires a key that can be acquired just up the hill off to the side of the first area.
* Throughout the duty you will come across goblins being attacked by mobs. These encounters are optional but can reward the party with treasure if the goblins are rescued.
