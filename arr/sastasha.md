## Chopper

**Tank/Melee DPS:** 
* Chopper will occasionally drop a PBAoE around itself. Step out as necessary.

---

## Captain Madison (Part One)

The first Madison fight has two adds. When the Captain runs away finish the adds and move on.

---

## Captain Madison (Part Two)

When Madison hits 50% HP he will summon adds from the side of the room.

**Tank:** 
* Keep alert for the dogs and grab them ASAP.

---

## Denn the Orcatoothed

The arena has four interactable grates that will periodically begin to bubble. Interacting with the bubbling grate will prevent an add from spawning.

**Tank:** 
* If adds spawn grab them ASAP.

**Healer:** 
* If adds spawn and leash you, run them towards the tank to get them peeled off. 

**DPS:** 
* Add spawns can spiral out of control depending on how fast the boss is getting burned down. Make sure to target them before things get too much for your tank and healer!

### *General Dungeon Tips*
* Look in the room to the side of the initial approach to find one of three random colors printed on an interactable. This references which of the three colored Coral Triggers you need to summon the first boss and reveal the exit door. Selecting the wrong Coral Trigger will spawn an additional enemy encounter.
* Early in the dungeon you will encounter Giant Clams that will continually spawn Shade Seeker adds until they are destroyed. Keep in mind that when the Giant Clam is closed it will be invulnerable.
* This dungeon has many optional rooms and halls that most groups will bypass for efficiency. If you don't have the exploration achievement for this dungeon feel free to ask your group if they'd be willing to do a full clear!
* If this is your first ever Duty Finder party, congratulations! You finished your first dungeon in Final Fantasy XIV! You'll probably be back here quite a few times in your future roulettes.
