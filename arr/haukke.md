## Manor Claviger

**Tank:** 
* Cleave attack
* Targeted AoE
* PBAoE

**Melee DPS:** 
* Watch out for the PBAoE

**NOTE:** The boss drops a key that unlocks a door to the next section. That door will be back through the entrace of the room, back the way you came.

## Manor Jester & Manor Steward

The Manor Steward is a melee enemy with a PBAoE and the Manor Jester is a ranged spellcaster. It is recommended to focus the Jester first.

**Tank:** 
* PBAoE (Steward)
* Two Targets Simultaneously

**Melee DPS:** 
* Watch out for the PBAoE

**NOTE:** This encounter drops a Bloody Parchment which will unlock the barrier back at the start of the dungeon... Which is where you want to go next. Use your Return skill to instantly return to the start of the manor.

## Lady Amandine

This encounter has plenty to do. 
* Early in the fight Void Lamps will illuminate in the four corners of the room and become interactible. Players should run to the lamps and extinguish them as fast as possible or they will constantly pulse, doing party-wide damage.
* She will cast spells that can be interrupted.
* She will summon Bomb adds that will explode after a time.
* At low HP she will summon several adds that must be defeated in order to resume damaging Lady Amandine and end the encounter.

**Tank:** 
* Keep an eye out for add spawns and grab them ASAP.
* It is possible to position yourself to help with Lamps but timing it can be difficult, as auto-attacks will interrupt your attemps.

**Healer:** 
* If left unchecked, the Void Lamps damage can add up.

**DPS:** 
* Switch focus to Lamps as a priority, then adds. 
* Make sure not to waste attacks on Amandine when she becomes invulnerable during the last add phase.

### *General Dungeon Tips*

Haukke Manor is one of the most complicated dungeons you'll experience early on... And honestly one of the most complicated in the whole game thus far.

* Start the dungeon by heading to the hallway on the left.
* The staircase at the very beginning of the dungeon leads straight up to the final boss and requires an item dropped from the second boss to unlock it.
* Look out for keys as you explore.
* There are many optional rooms and halls in Haukke Manor. Some require Tiny Keys to open. Treasure Chests and additional keys may be found inside.
* Manor Maidservants are a significant threat. They will cast a PBAoE fear shortly after being engaged. It can be interrupted, though!
