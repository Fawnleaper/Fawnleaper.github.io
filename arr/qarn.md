## Teratotaur

* Dung Wespes will be summoned periodically. They will eventually cast Final Sting which can be fatal.
* Teratotaur will cast an unavoidable Doom debuff that will kill once the timer on it expires. 
  * The debuff can only be cleansed by standing on the floor panel that is currently glowing.

**Tank:**
* Frightful Roar - PBAoE, Vulnerability Up
* Mow - Conal, Poison
* Untelegraphed tankbuster

**Healer:** 
* Be prepared in case Final Sting can't be stopped in time. Quick action can prevent death.
* Watch for Vuln Up/Poison.
* Watch for the triple-hitting tankbuster.

**DPS:**
* Switch focus to Wespes ASAP to avoid losing anyone to Final Sting.
* Avoid Frightful Roar.

## Temple Guardian

* The Golem Soulstone must be destroyed to initiate the damage phase.
  * Temple Guardian will be stunned during this phase and will become resistant to attacks again when the Soulstone respawns.
* There are various dodgeable AoE's of varying shape and size.
* Temple Guardian can ignore enmity and randomly target other players, particularly with a heavy-hitting knockback.

**Healer:** 
* Watch out for untanked damage when the boss goes rogue.

**DPS:**
* Focus damage on the Golem Soulstone whenever it appears.
* Save cooldowns for the damage phase to minimize the number of cycles needed.

## Adjudicator

* Darkness - Frontal Cone AoE w/ Blind
* Paralyze - Targeted Paralyze
* Creeping Darkness - Instant Party-Wide Damage
* Summons Sun Jurors which must be killed on glowing floor plates to prevent respawn.
* Summons Mithril Verges which should be destroyed ASAP
  * Summons black spaces which will become walled off shortly after appearing. 
    * Players should enter these spaces before they are locked out in order to destroy the Verge that spawns inside.


### *General Dungeon Tips*

* Qarn introduces you to awful, awful BEES! They should be destroyed ASAP due to their brutal Final Sting attack. It can and will kill.
* The Qarn Facer met early in the dungeon has a Treasure Chest inside it! It will attempt to run away but worry not, you'll bump into it again later.
* As you progress you'll find stone tablets marked with symbols. These can be used to unlock optional rooms and the final boss room.
  * The Vault of Steel - Helm of Might
  * The Vault of Riches - Gem of Affluence
  * The Vault of Secrets - Fruit of Knowledge
  * The Vault of Aether - Flame of Magic
  * The Scales of Judgment - Flame on the left, Fruit on the right, tip scales.
 * After the first boss the stone head enemies will need to be killed while on top of glowing plates to prevent them coming back to life. 
  * Positioning for them can be fiddly so make sure aggro isn't all over the place.
