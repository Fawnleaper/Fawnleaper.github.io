## Firemane

Periodically Firemane will summon wisp adds from different parts of the room. If they reach the firepit in the center of the arena they will detonate, doing party-wide damage.

**Healer:** 
* Watch for wisps close to detonation. Several missed wisps with a low-geared party can do a lot of damage all at once.

**DPS:** 
* When the fire light in the room gets brighter adds will begin to float in. Switch priority to damaging these to avoid excess group damage.

## Thunderclap Guivre

The Guivre will occasionally run to the center of the water and electrify it while summoning elemental adds. Once the adds are defeated you can reposition it again.

**Tank:** 
* Keep the Guivre pointed away from the party but mind your footing when it runs in to electrify the water.

**DPS:** 
* Switch focus to the elementals during the intermission phases.

## Tangata

* The mechanics for this boss are very similar to Firemane from earlier, except HE is the firepit and he can move/be positioned.
* The fire wisps will explode when they touch Tangata.
* When the fire wisps are summoned he will become surrounded by fire and become invulnerable. Kill the adds to progress.
* Eventually with enough damage he will no longer become invulnerable during the add phase.

**Tank:** 
* Tangata does a frontal cone attack so watch your positioning.
* In the portions of the fight where he's invulnerable and summoning adds feel free to drop focus on the boss and help out the DPS.
* Towards the end when he is NOT invulnerable during the add phase you can pull him wherever you want, which may be useful to avoid wisp explosions.

**DPS:** 
* Prioritize adds, just like with Firemane.

### *General Dungeon Tips*

**Tank/Healer:** 
* The snake mobs in this dungeon can do a wicked spicy hit, especially at lower levels.

* As you proceed through Halatali you'll need to activate five Chain Winch interactables. Pulling one can randomly spawn elementals, a bomb monster, or nothing at all.
* This dungeon has a fun optional chest towards the end on the other side of an empty platform. Heading towards it will spawn a surprise enemy. Great for a fun prank!
