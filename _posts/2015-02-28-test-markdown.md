Welcome to the... Let's say "Alpha" of this little project. Duty Commenced (The Yolodex) is an idea I've had bounding around in my head for years. The concept initially was to create for myself a little desk rolodex with reminders about mechanics for all the dungeons in Final Fantasy XIV. There are so many, after all, and sometimes Duty Roulette throws you one that you haven't done in a very, very long time.

Of course there are other resources out there: Wikis and videos and such... But I've found that, personally, the wikis tend to be bloated and hard to pull up on, say, a mobile browser and videos, as good as they are, take more than a glance to consume. 

Eventually my desktop rolodex evolved into "Why don't I make a very simple website that is mobile friendly and easy to access one handed while you're prepping a run?"

This is how this little project came to be.

I will be perfectly happy if, when complete, this only serves as a tool for myself personally BUT I would be over the moon if the FFXIV community got some use out of this as well.

If you're looking at this right now chances are you're a personal friend and/or a contributor to the project. I'll be adding dungeons when I have time to do so and hope to have it current (at least for 4-man Duties) within the next few months. Of course we're mere days from 5.0 launching so that will add to the workload a bit...

So thank you for checking this out and if you have any comments or suggestions please let me know!
